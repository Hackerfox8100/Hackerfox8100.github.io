## Blue Team Resources
![Blue Team Title Image](resources/blueBackground.jpg)

Defensive cybersecurity is my default assumption when someone brings up career paths within the field. Most of my major's classes target these skills, but I've found myself most engaged with blue team topics when preparing for competitions like the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) and the Department of Energy's CyberForce Competition. As finish up my college experience I will be adding more resources, so check back for updates as I continue learning new techniques!
