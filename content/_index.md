## About Me

I am currently a Cybersecurity Analytics and Operations major and Political Science minor at Penn State University. I am researching the gamification of cybersecurity and how it can effect retention and engagement within the subject matter. My goal is to continue expanding my skills and learning as much as I can while helping others achieve their cyber goals.
