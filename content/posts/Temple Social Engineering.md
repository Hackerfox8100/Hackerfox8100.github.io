* Different positions available than what was previously offered
* Doesn't know anything about compliance
	* not something that was on Sam's resume
	* does not know what compliance means
* HR position being offered is more of a managerial position, not consistent with a job offer for a fresh grad
	* not interested in HR, so asking about admin assistant instead
* Swift responses and long replies from "interviewer" are consistent with an AI chatbot
* Sam wants to apply for the admin assistant role
* *the scam likely is gonna be with purchasing the office equipment
* Immediate hire
* The interviewer account name is spelled wrong

## Job Offer/Follow Up Notes

	* Sam is excited and this makes her feel like she is doing well

	* tuition reimbursement
	* stock purchase plan
	* etc

* Replies are still super fast from the employer
* Paid during training
* Long text messages again
* Sam is most focused on the money and is losing sight of other red flags
* EOD email came immediately
* Advice to Sam after the follow up
	* don't provide credit card info or SSN due to scam profile that's reported - need to be cautious
	* bring up the BBB report
	* exact email everything matches. so we shouldm't provide info to them, if they ask about a cc it's 100% the scam. scam used teams, offer was very fast 
	* spelling mistakes, things that didn't make sense, etc.

# Day 3
## Formal Debrief Notes

* Asked how BBB scam report works
	* Send your case over to help them build their case
