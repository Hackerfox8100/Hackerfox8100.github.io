# Politics of Terrorism Simulation
## Overview

## Roles
* Chair
	* Lindsay Fusco
* Scribe
	* Me!
* Public Relations Officer
	* 
* Liaison Officers
	* Ashlee Wilson
## Gameplan
 * Other committees, especially government ones will likely not want to talk to us
	 * In order to make sure we get the attention we need, it might be advantageous to offer "after action reviews" to the different committees after each ways.
	 * The goal would be to 
## News Item 1
* ISIS-K committed a deadly terrorist attack against Kabul, the capitol of Afghanistan, with a series of suicide bombers
* 25 people were killed and 200 were injured in the three attacks
* Afghan government associated with the Taliban government blamed attacks on ISIS-K
	* ISIS-K is responsible for killing 183 Afghans and 13 U.S. soldiers 

Our plan as the social media companies was to release a PR statement that outlines the following:
* We have been alerted about a terrorist attack that is affecting Afghanistan
* We have alerted our content reviewers and they have been advised to take extra content when reviewing content regarding the attack
* We will be removing extremely graphic content from our site and putting a warning on potentially graphic or disturbing content to ensure the mental wellbeing of our viewers.
This is what was released:

Convo with intelligence committee
* wants to know if we have information about the attacks that they can have
* We told them to wait 
	* Deliverables:
		* With our review for content warnings
			* Intel wants to be alerted of this
		* DMs with keywords relating to terrorist attacks
First Note

Convo with the EU
* detected lots of chatter about the attack especially in their countries
* Do we have any info for them.

Second Note
