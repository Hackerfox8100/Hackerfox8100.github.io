# Politics of Terrorism Simulation
## Overview

## Roles
* Chair
	* Lindsay Fusco
* Scribe
	* Me!
* Public Relations Officer
	* 
* Liaison Officers
	* Ashlee Wilson
## Gameplan
 * Other committees, especially government ones will likely not want to talk to us
	 * In order to make sure we get the attention we need, it might be advantageous to offer "after action reviews" to the different committees after each ways.
	 * The goal would be to 
## Day 1 (4/16)
#### News Item 1
* ISIS-K committed a deadly terrorist attack against Kabul, the capitol of Afghanistan, with a series of suicide bombers
* 25 people were killed and 200 were injured in the three attacks
* Afghan government associated with the Taliban government blamed attacks on ISIS-K
	* ISIS-K is responsible for killing 183 Afghans and 13 U.S. soldiers 

Our plan as the social media companies was to release a PR statement that outlines the following:
* We have been alerted about a terrorist attack that is affecting Afghanistan
* We have alerted our content reviewers and they have been advised to take extra content when reviewing content regarding the attack
* We will be removing extremely graphic content from our site and putting a warning on potentially graphic or disturbing content to ensure the mental wellbeing of our viewers.
This is what was released:

**Convo with intelligence committee**
* wants to know if we have information about the attacks that they can have
* We told them to wait 
	* Deliverables:
		* With our review for content warnings
			* Intel wants to be alerted of this
		* DMs with keywords relating to terrorist attacks
	* Our plan is to give public info but still need a subpoena for direct messages
		* response from intel
			* coolio

#### First Note
>"Online security and disinformation officers of the major social media firms are reporting an increase in activity from social media accounts associated with violent extremist groups. These group accounts have been sharing information and footage of the recent ISIS-K attack and have provided links to other websites run by ISIS-K. Security officers are also concerned about the increase in disinformation posted on social media regarding the ISIS-K attack. This includes disinformation claiming that the attack was a "false flag" attack that was caused by the US CIA."

**Convo with the EU**
* detected lots of chatter about the attack especially in their countries
* Do we have any info for them.

#### Second Note
>"Members of congress have called for hearings on social media companies and extremist online content. They allege that social media companies are not doing enough to combat extremist content and are not cooperating enough with authorities. Similar hearings are planned for parliaments in European countries."

**World Bank**
* Pakistani gov taking in large number of refugees
* Shia Muslim majority
* struggling to take in refugees
* allocated resources?
	* waiting for more information to take action
* Is EU or US allocated any resources
	* still formulating a response

**EU condemns the attack**
* will be sending healthcare food and education
* How are they gonna get the money?
	* tax money!
	* trends in past actions that prove they should be able to do this
* how is aid going to not be taken my militants?
	* Idk
	* goal is that countries receiving aid are responsible for the proper allocation

**Help from LA**
* prolly going to get an uptick on the meeting that just happened, as in EU condemning the attack
	* banning policies
	* more flagging content
	* extremist on each sides
	* world bank may be good to get funding from to handle attack
	* Europe can be very racist in how they handle middle eastern policy
	* state department also has racist issues and money 

**Human right committee announcement**
* France and Belgium are reporting that Muslim populations in Europe are experience discrimination in the form of surveillance and scrutiny from police

**EU response**
* working with US intel
* Dismayed by hate crimes
* working to ensure safety of all citizens

**Split up to ask for money and to release a pr statement for EU**
* PR statement goal is to update that we are asking for funding, especially in light 

**Talk with world bank:**
* funds and resources to flag more content, pay for more translators, etc
* counter terrorism finance, usually to other governments
	* doesn't want to fund because we have money
* funding would be going to more niche platforms too that don't have money so that we can cooperate and help out
* offered consultants and advise
* will get back on funding, focus on other committees first
* mentioned that they don't have a platform for other committees to release they can help,
	* could be used as leverage later\

#### Break on day one
* look at us and EU laws on sharing information
* draft potential PR statements
* get update from World bank
* Draft response to congress and EU
	* Congress response is more important (second note)
* research what actual social media companies do

## Day 2 (4/23)
* GDPR: General data protection regulation

**Start of day 2**
* PR statement on how we are being extra watchful for disinformation and misconduct against Muslims and other vulnerable populations in France and Belgium as well as the global community
* Congress: 
	* trying to get funding for technology and training to specifically handle extremist content
	* We are trying to work within the US laws to cooperate as much as possible 

#### Third Note
>"Online security officers from the major social media companies continue to report an increase in activity from the major social media accounts that are associated with the ISIS-K and other violent extremist organizations. More worryingly, posts and videos from ISIS-K are increasingly being shared on accounts used by US domestic extremist actors that previously have expressed little interest in ISIS-K."

**US Intelligence**


**Human Rights Committee**
* World Bank isn't doing enough to help refugees

**EU Releases own patriot act**
* Need to get clarification on specific policies, cause this could potentially be pretty bad
* Europe might not like this Americanesque policy
	* might face backlash

**DOD Conversation**
* couple indictments of several us army officers for sharing online extremist content
* Military trial, handled by military (so differently and more none private)

**EU Conversations**
* any chatter about terrorist activity on the EU
	* radical ideas, extremist content, etc.
* Not entirely sure what they are looking for from us

Clarification on their patriot act
* period of 2 years, renewable
* not targeting any population
* more surveillance monitoring on social media
* no censoring 
	* freedom of speech is important
* IPSs to disclose content to EU in states of emergency

**Press release from social media**
* Are you monitoring specific state or all of EU?
	* Yes

**US Intel Conversations**
* what does EU monitoring look based on our recent press statement

**Circle Back To Congress**
* Congressional support
	* How are we going to do it, fit both sides of content, polarized
* Could consult human rights about best way to handle that

**Conversation with Human rights**
* How do we approach this from a neutral standpoint?
	* avoid labeling specific people as extremist
* OR can you accompany us to the congress hearing to make sure human rights are an upmost concern

* looking to flag and warn violent content
* looked to get more funding to provide more enhanced training 
	* nuances and how that effects viewers
	* extremist content tech
* talked about GDPR and how we need to work within that
* mentioned new patriot act as well
Response
* previously seen a lack of ability to monitor hateful content in different languages
* asked about AI and if that is a possibility
	* not really a possibility because of drift and the nature of the extremist content
* going in a good direction, not looking to pass legislation against us at the moment
* are we looking into counter messaging
	* intel may be able to help 
	* Human rights wants to make sure this is neutral and walk the fine line 

**Press statements at EU**
* High threat of attack in Belgium, so declared state of emergency which triggers their patriot act 
* Does not impact refugee deal (not sure what that is)

#### News Item 2
>"A deadly terrorist attack shook the capital of Belgium today as a team of militants struck the Brussels-Zaventem airport. Belgium Federal Police report that eight people were killed in the attack and more have been injured. Authorities warn that these numbers could increase as first responders assess the situation.
>
>The attack began while passengers were checking in for a flight to the United States. A group of attackers entered the ticketing area and opened fire with automatic weapons. Belgian authorities have closed the airport and have grounded flights nationally.
>
>Immediately after the attack, the Islamic State of Khorasan (ISIS-K) claimed responsibility for the assault on a social media site. "This is the first of many strikes we will make. We struck the near enemy. Now we have struck the far enemy."
